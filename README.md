# Fashion_mnist_Image_Processing
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying clothing items in the Fashion MNIST dataset. Built using Keras and TensorFlow, the model achieves an impressive 89% accuracy on unseen test data, demonstrating its capability in garment identification. The well-structured CNN architecture combines convolutional and pooling layers to extract key features from images, leading to the strong performance. Feel free to explore the code and see how it tackles the image classification challenge!
